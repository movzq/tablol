    This is a project to implement something like "excel" but -= 10000, however it is just for funny,
    the idea was taken from a Tsoding video. The idea was successfully implemented, so the program
    is able to do arithmetic operations, cells cloning and error reporting.

    Errors:
    * num_defintion: Wrong number defintion (Maybe..?).
    * empty_cell: The current cell has not any tokens.
    * loop_dependecy: A loop between cells occured.
    * outta_range: Trying to clone a cell that doesn't exist.
    * missing_args: Ain't operands nor operators enough to perform any arithmetic operation.

    Clone method:
    To be able to clone a cell the syntaxis must look like: @<column><row>
    where column is a serie of upper-case letters and row is the row number (The orden does not matter).
